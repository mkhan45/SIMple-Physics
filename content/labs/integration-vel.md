# Velocity Update and Integration

integration-vel

["Gravity"]

In this lab, you'll learn about loops and see how the position update
equation can be used to simulate objects with acceleration.

Make sure you understand [the tutorial](https://simple-physics.org/tutorial/gravity.html)
and [the previous integration lab](https://simple-physics.org/lab/integration-pos.html) before doing this lab.
