            <h3> Overview </h3>
            <p>
            The core of SIMple Physics is the 2D scene UI. Through this UI, you can inspect and interact
            with physics objects, viewing properties such as position, mass, and velocity. SIMple Physics
            comes with a very minimal physics engine built in; the real power comes from the scripting
            engine. Through the scripting engine, users can disable the built-in physics engine and write
            custom physics code. This allows two main lab types:
            <ul class="-mt-2">
              <li> Labs where the student implements a physics concept from scratch, and then experiment with it </li>
              <li> Labs where the instructor creates a scene, and the students experiment on it </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
