SIMple Physics is a set of educational physics simulators. It is made to help students and teachers conduct labs and experiments for high school level physics without sophisticated and expensive equipment.

Important goals include:

- Performance even on lower spec'd machines
- Cross platform
- Ease of use
- Free and [Open Source](https://github.com/mkhan45/SIMple-Physics)
- Extensibility

SIMple Physics aims to include a separate simulator for each section of high school physics, including:

- ✔️ Kinematics, Projectile Motion, and basic Mechanics (SIMple Mechanics) [Github](https://github.com/mkhan45/gravity-sim-v2)
- ✔️ Universal Gravitation (SIMple Gravity) [Github](https://github.com/mkhan45/physics-v2)
- ❌Electromagnetics and Magnetism
- ❌Waves and Optics

Each simulator has a few core features to help learn and teach physics. For example,

- Save and load preset scenes
- Graph object properties and export graphs to CSV
- Extensive documentation and example labs
